                    <h3>Course Synopsis</h3>
                    <p>This course bridges key concepts of microeconomics with applications in technology, AI, digitization, and computer science. Using real-world case studies, students will explore economic principles and analyze their role in shaping technology-driven decisions and innovation. The course emphasizes practical application and strategic thinking.</p>
                    <p>The course covers the principles of economics as a theory of rational choice and the operation of a market economy. Students study consumer choice (utility maximization), the behavior of firms (costs and optimal production), and the supply-demand model under perfect competition. The latter part focuses on more realistic market structures (monopolies, oligopolies) and organizational architecture, including principal-agent problems.</p>
