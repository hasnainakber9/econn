                    <h3>The Role of Scarcity</h3>
                    <p>Economics is the study of how we make decisions in a world of limited resources (scarcity). Because we can't have everything, we must make choices. In tech, this means a company has scarce resources like engineering hours, server capacity, and capital. They must choose *what* to build.</p>

                    <h3>Opportunity Cost & Trade-offs (PPF)</h3>
                    <p>The **Opportunity Cost** is the value of the next-best alternative you give up when you make a choice. If you spend 100 engineer hours on AI features, you can't spend those same hours on a new mobile app. The lost mobile app development is the opportunity cost.</p>
                    <p>This trade-off can be shown with a **Production Possibilities Frontier (PPF)**. It shows the maximum possible combinations of two products a company can produce with its given resources.</p>
                    <div class="chart-container">
                        <canvas id="ppfChart"></canvas>
                    </div>
                    <ul class="chart-caption">
                        <li><strong>Point A & B:</strong> Efficient. All resources are fully used.</li>
                        <li><strong>Point C:</strong> Inefficient. Resources are wasted (e.g., engineers on standby).</li>
                        <li><strong>Point D:</strong> Unattainable. Not possible with current resources.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Scarcity and Innovation</h4>
                    <p>Innovation (like a new coding framework or AI tool) makes us more productive. It pushes the entire PPF outward, allowing us to produce *more* of both goods with the same resources. This makes "Point D" attainable.</p>

                <div class="accordion-content">
                    <h3>Demand for Digital Products</h3>
                    <p>The **Law of Demand** still applies: as the price of a digital product (like a streaming subscription or software) falls, the quantity demanded generally increases.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Determinants of Demand (Shifts)</h4>
                    <p>These factors can change the *entire* demand for a product at every price, shifting the curve.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Consumer Preferences:</strong> A product going "viral" or getting a great review shifts demand right.</li>
                        <li><strong>Prices of Related Goods:</strong> If a competitor (substitute) raises its price, demand for your product shifts right.</li>
                        <li><strong>Income:</strong> For most "normal" goods, as income rises, demand shifts right.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <div class="chart-container">
                        <canvas id="demandShiftChart"></canvas>
                    </div>
                    <p class="chart-caption">A positive review shifts demand from D1 to D2, leading to a higher equilibrium price (P2) and quantity (Q2).</p>

                    <h4>Supply of Digital Products</h4>
                    <p>This is where digital products are unique. They often have high *fixed costs* (cost to build the first copy) but near-zero *marginal costs* (cost to sell one more copy). This can affect supply dynamics, but the basic model is still used.</p>
                    <p>The full Supply, Demand, and Equilibrium model is covered in <strong>Section 4</strong>.</p>

                <div class="accordion-content">
                    <p>Case studies like Hurricane Sandy are often used to analyze market responses to crises and the effect of government policies.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Price Ceilings and Shortages</h4>
                    <p>During a crisis, the demand for essential goods (like water, generators, gas) skyrockets, shifting demand right. This would normally cause prices to rise sharply (price gouging).</p>
                    <p>To prevent this, governments often impose a **Price Ceiling**, a legal maximum price. While well-intentioned, this creates a **shortage**: at the low, legal price, consumers demand far more (Q<sub>d</sub>) than suppliers are willing to sell (Q<sub>s</sub>).</p>

                    <h4>Implicit vs. Explicit Costs</h4>
                    <p>To understand a business, we must consider two types of costs:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Explicit Costs:</strong> Obvious, out-of-pocket payments. (e.g., employee salaries, rent, materials).</li>
                        <li><strong>Implicit Costs:</strong> Opportunity costs. What the business owner gives up. (e.g., the $80,000/year salary the owner could be earning at another job).</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Accounting Profit vs. Economic Profit</h4>
                    <p>This distinction is critical for decision-making.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Accounting Profit</strong> = Total Revenue - Explicit Costs</li>
                        <li><strong>Economic Profit</strong> = Total Revenue - (Explicit Costs + Implicit Costs)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>A firm can have a positive Accounting Profit but a negative Economic Profit, meaning the owner would be better off closing the business and taking the other job.</p>

                    <h4>Total, Fixed, and Variable Costs</h4>
                    <p>Production costs are broken down into:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Total Fixed Cost (TFC):</strong> Costs that don't change with output (e.g., factory rent).</li>
                        <li><strong>Total Variable Cost (TVC):</strong> Costs that *do* change with output (e.g., materials, labor).</li>
                        <li><strong>Total Cost (TC):</strong> TC = TFC + TVC</li>
                    </ul>
                    <div class="chart-container">
                        <canvas id="totalCostChart"></canvas>
                    </div>
                    <p class="chart-caption">Note how TFC is a flat line, and the TC curve is just the TVC curve shifted up by the amount of TFC.</p>

                    <h3>Characteristics</h3>
                    <p>A "price taker" market model with many firms, identical products, and easy entry/exit.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Q27:</strong> The firm's demand curve is perfectly elastic (horizontal) because it must accept the market price. The *industry* demand curve is still downward-sloping.</li>
                        <li><strong>Q29:</strong> Firms can't advertise; the product is standardized, so there's nothing to differentiate.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Profit Maximization (TR/TC Approach)</h4>
                    <p>Firms maximize profit at the output level where Total Revenue (TR) exceeds Total Cost (TC) by the largest amount.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p class="chart-caption">Profit is maximized at Output = 9, where the gap between TR and TC is largest (as shown by the profit bars).</p>

                            <strong>Q25: Shutdown Rule (Short-Run)</strong>
                            <p>If Market Price < minimum AVC, the firm should shut down immediately. It loses less money (only its fixed costs) than it would by producing.</p>

                            <strong>Q24 & Q26: Long-Run Equilibrium</strong>
                            <p>Abnormal profits (like in the chart) attract new firms. This increases market supply, which pushes the price down until all firms earn only "normal profit" (where P = ATC).</p>
